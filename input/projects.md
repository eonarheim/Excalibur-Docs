## Excalibur.js

[I contribute]() to and maintain on an open-source game engine for JavaScript/TypeScript based games called [Excalibur.js](https://excaliburjs.com/) with my buddies [Kamran Ayub](https://kamranicus.com/), [Josh Edeen](https://www.joshedeen.com/), and  [Alan Grigic](https://github.com/alanag13). I work a lot on the internal subsystems of Excalibur, lately I've been specializing in the mathematics and physics portions of the engine. 

Excalibur has become a very large piece of software since we started several years ago. It has now evovled into a robust, modular piece of open source software with a complete CI/CD system for both Windows and Linux using AppVeyor and TravisCI respectively. The project has be a great way for us to grow as OSS maintainers, and we've been really pleased to receive several contributions from the community.

Some games I've built with Excalibur.js:

### Crypt of the Minotaur

## TypeState

[TypeState](https://github.com/eonarheim/TypeState) is an open source TypeScript based simple finite state machine library I built to help me model simple behaviors in a statically typed way. TypeState has been used to build simple AIs for games, and mod

## HyperAsteroids

[HyperAsteroids](https://github.com/eonarheim/hyperasteroids) is fun little multiplayer asteroids game that I built to demostrate how to build a simple multiplayer server in Node.js using websockets driven by Socket.io. I've managed to run HyperAsteroids with around 50 concurrent people, not bad for a tiny multiplayer server ;)
