This week I ran across a problem when building a custom extension method to format a `PATCH` request to an api endpoint. Basically I wanted to create a `PatchAsync` method that matched the same semantics as `PostAsync` and `GetAsync` in `HttpClient`. I had some more unique JSON serialization requirements working with the [IIS Admin rest api](https://erikonarheim.com/posts/iis-admin-rest-api-with-dsc) like `snake_casing` and booleans and numbers serialized at string literals like "124" or "true", so I needed to be able to pass my own JSON.NET configuration to the serialization.

Borrowing from this [SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26218764/patch-async-requests-with-windows-web-http-httpclient-class) I crafted this extension method:

```csharp
public static async Task<HttpResponseMessage> PatchAsync<T>(this HttpClient client, string requestUri, T value, MediaTypeFormatter formatter)
{
    var method = new HttpMethod("PATCH");

    HttpRequestMessage request;

    using (var ms = new MemoryStream()) {
        var jsonFormatter = formatter as JsonMediaTypeFormatter;
        
        jsonFormatter?.WriteToStream(typeof(T), value, ms, Encoding.UTF8);

        var content = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(ms.GetBuffer(), 0, (int)ms.Length);
        request = new HttpRequestMessage(method, requestUri)
        {                    
            Content = new StringContent(content, Encoding.UTF8, jsonFormatter?.SupportedMediaTypes.First()?.MediaType)
        };
    }

    HttpResponseMessage response;
    try
    {
        response = await client.SendAsync(request);
    }
    catch (TaskCanceledException e)
    {
        throw e;
    }

    return response;
}
    
```

As far as I could tell from human eyeballs everything looked good, but when I ran this code from code it would bomb with "Unsupported Media Type: Invalid JSON". I could craft the same request by hand in [fiddler](http://www.telerik.com/fiddler) or [postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) and it would work!

I did notice one odd artifact in the requests, the `Content-Length` didn't match up between the failing and succeeding requests even with what looked like the same payload...

Aaaah HAAAA! There must be some invisible characters my dear Watson!

So I cracked open the trusty HEX editor and lo and behold! A BOM (literally) aka a byte order mark has snuck it's way inbetween my request headers and JSON payload! This 3-byte mark is included in UTF encoded stuff to help readers decode correctly. Ironically it breaks some deserializers, like the one in the IIS Rest Admin API!

Successful request:

Failed request:

After I discovered this the fix was pretty easy, [.NET provides](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/s064f8w2.aspx) a new `UTF8Encoding` type that can be passed true or false to its constructor to indicated whether a BOM is wanted.

So the fixed extension method:

```csharp
public static async Task<HttpResponseMessage> PatchAsync<T>(this HttpClient client, string requestUri, T value, MediaTypeFormatter formatter)
{
    var method = new HttpMethod("PATCH");

    HttpRequestMessage request;

    // No BOM now
    var utf8 = new UTF8Encoding(false);

    using (var ms = new MemoryStream()) {
        var jsonFormatter = formatter as JsonMediaTypeFormatter;
        
        jsonFormatter?.WriteToStream(typeof(T), value, ms, utf8);

        var content = utf8.GetString(ms.GetBuffer(), 0, (int)ms.Length);
        request = new HttpRequestMessage(method, requestUri)
        {                    
            Content = new StringContent(content, utf8, jsonFormatter?.SupportedMediaTypes.First()?.MediaType)
        };
    }

    HttpResponseMessage response;
    try
    {
        response = await client.SendAsync(request);
    }
    catch (TaskCanceledException e)
    {
        throw e;
    }

    return response;
}
    
```

Hopefully this helps out any of you JSON payload peeps trying to customize HttpClient. Somebody set us up the ðŸ’£!
